        <description><![CDATA[ <p>In the past days, I have been hacking on
<a href="https://sourceware.org/libabigail/">libabigail</a> to write a tool named
fedabipkgdiff. That came from a cool idea of Dodji Seketeli who is the author
of libabigail and is built on top of the powerful libabigail framework. Just
imagine, if you are a Fedora developer or packager, when you want to ensure
the new version software is ABI-compatible with previous version or versions,
how would you do that? If there are already built builds in Koji, if you want
to see what ABI differences they have, then how to do that? fedabipkgdiff is
able to make your life easier.</p>

<p>fedabipkgdiff is designed to be as smart as possible to find necessary RPMs
from local or Koji, and run ABI check automatically on behalf of you. All you
need to do is just to specify</p>

<ul>
<li>from where to find RPMs, which defaults to Koji obviously</li>
<li>what RPMs are needed, to select RPMs from latest build of a distribution
such as Fedora 24, 25, or from a specific build with <code>N-V-R</code> such as
<code>httpd-2.4.23-4.fc24</code></li>
<li>how RPMs will be compared, that means you have a chance to let fedabipkgdiff
do not compare with development package, you can also tell it to compare
without loading suppression file</li>
</ul>


<p>Okay, now I'll show you some examples to see what fedabipkgdiff can do.</p>

<p>First, I want to compare package httpd selected from latest build built for
Fedora 24 and 25. Run this command</p>

<pre>
fedabipkgdiff --from 24 --to 25 httpd
</pre>


<p>You will get</p>

<p>The output from fedabipkgdiff has a regular format. For each section of
comparison between versions of RPMs, fedabipkgdiff displays ABI difference of
each binary one by one. As shown above, its format follows.</p>

<pre>
Comparing the ABI of binaries between foo-N-V-R.A.rpm and httpd-N-V-R.A.rpm:

================ changes of 'binary name'===============

  { summar lines }

  { a list of changed functions with details }

================ end of changes of 'httpd'===============
</pre>


<p>Second, I want to compare package httpd from two builds with specific <code>N-V-R</code>
rather than the latest one. Run this command</p>

<pre>
fedabipkgdiff httpd-2.4.23-3.fc23 httpd-2.4.23-3.fc24
</pre>


<p>As a result, you will ABI differences in similar format like above. This
command compares all RPMs with all arches.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if it is just necessary to compare RPMs with arch <code>x86_64</code>, I
can do in this way,</p>

<pre>
fedabipkgdiff httpd-2.4.23-3.fc23.x86_64 httpd-2.4.23-3.fc24.x86_64
</pre>


<p>fedabipkgdiff is trying to compare ABI of binaries as smart as possible for
Fedora developers and packagers. Besides what I have shown to you above, you
can do more with fedabipkgdiff by specifying various options. For more
details, please refer to <a href="https://sourceware.org/libabigail/manual/fedabipkgdiff.html">official
manual</a>, or <code>man
fedabipkgdiff</code>.</p>
